# Nifty Gallery

Nifty Gallery is a tool for exploring NFT collections using Rust WebAssembly. The site can be viewed at https://niftygallery.evilrobot.industries and is still a work in progress.

It currently has two modes of exploration:
- Enter a contract address, which will use the Etherscan API to resolve the collection metadata from the contract 
- Enter a metadata url (e.g. https://ikzttp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQFkLSQysj94s5GvTHPyzTxrawwtjgiiYS2TBLgrvw8CW/0) to browse the collection directly

Finally, it can also be used to browse a local collection generated using [Nifty Generator](https://github.com/evilrobotindustries/nifty-generator). More information on how to get this running at [nifty-generator#exploration]( https://github.com/evilrobotindustries/nifty-generator#exploration).
